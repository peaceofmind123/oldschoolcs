### Push-Relabel Deep Dive

We maintain heights $h(v)$ and excess $e(v)$, pushing admissible edges where $h(v) = h(w) + 1$. Relabeling ensures progress:

```
while excess(v) > 0:
  if exists admissible edge (v, w):
    push(v, w)
  else:
    relabel(v)
```

The gap heuristic yields $O(V^3)$ complexity. We visualize height labels with annotated columns and show how they collapse when a gap appears.
