### Primer: building intuition

Consider a directed network \( G = (V, E) \) with capacities \( c(u, v) \). The goal is to maximize the flow \( f \) from source \( s \) to sink \( t \) while meeting constraints:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 &\le f(u, v) \le c(u, v) \\\\
\sum_{(u, v) \in E} f(u, v) &= \sum_{(v, u) \in E} f(v, u) \quad \text{for all } v \ne s, t
\end{aligned}
$$

We start with a small example and animate augmenting paths directly in your browser.

### Residual Graphs & Cuts

Residual capacity is defined as \( c_f(u,v) = c(u,v) - f(u,v) \). Visualizing residual networks is easier with photos or diagrams:

We link out to embeded video explainers to keep the bundle light:

### Push-Relabel Deep Dive

We combine heuristics such as highest-label selection and gap relabeling. Pseudocode is rendered inline:

```pseudo
while excess(v) > 0:
  if exists admissible edge (v, w):
    push(v, w)
  else:
    relabel(v)
```
