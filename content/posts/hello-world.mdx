Welcome to OldSchool CS. This post demonstrates inline math $ e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0 $ and a display equation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

We can also write summations and integrals:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Lists and code work as usual:

- Bold claims require proofs.
- Algorithms like Dijkstra's can be expressed succinctly.

```tsx
export function add(a: number, b: number) {
	return a + b;
}
```
